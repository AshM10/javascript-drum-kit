## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- The keyboard input element
- Keydown event listener
- Data Attributes
- JS Window (BOM)

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="keys">
  <div data-key="65" class="key">
    <kbd>A</kbd>
    <span class="sound">clap</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
const keys = document.querySelectorAll(".key");
keys.forEach((key) => key.addEventListener("transitionend", removeTransition));
window.addEventListener("keydown", playSound);
```

### Continued development
